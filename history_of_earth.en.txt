The Milky Way Galaxy collides with a nearby dwarf galaxy
The Milky Way collides with nearby dwarf galaxies, causing an explosive starburst.
Our counterpart was one of them.
Inside the galaxy, a great cycle of matter was taking place.
As the material in the Ghar-Enbu approached the sun, its water content evaporated and it became dry.
Thus, a distribution of particles with different water content was created.
Eventually, the general circulation of matter ceased as the total stationary flow stopped.
This created areas of high particle density.
where collisions due to wine turbidity occur frequently.
Gradually, the particles grew into larger and larger asteroids.
These micro-planets repeatedly collided with each other
And then they grew into even bigger planets.
Because so many planets were born in the same orbit
So many planets were born in the same orbit that the proto-Earth collided with a Mars-sized planet.
This collision produced the moon.
This is how the present Earth with its moon was born.
The dry primordial Earth did not yet have an atmospheric ocean.
Then, from outside the snow line, many sun and ice planets came down.
The carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen contained in these microplanets created the atmosphere of the Earth.
Over a period of about 200 million years, the Earth would develop an atmosphere and oceans.
The atomic oceans, however, contain large amounts of heavy metal elements that are poisonous to life.
It was a poisonous sentence for life.
Some of the micro-planets that flew in were up to 1000 kilometers in diameter.
The area near the impact point was a plasma or laughing room upon impact.
The surface was covered with magma.
In the center of the crater, the central nine of the basement chamber was formed, which triggered an upward flow into the mantle.
This creates an upwelling in the mantle.
Cooled and hardened magma surface is thinner than continental crust
This is called oceanic crust.
This is called oceanic crust.
Water flowed into the inside of the huge crater
Eventually, it became a large ocean.
The mantle continued to rise.
The mantle continued to rise, creating an inverted eye in the oceanic crust.
And that was unusual.
The plates that were lifted began to slide sideways under their own gravity.
Plate tectonics had begun.
The denser oceanic crust begins to subduct beneath the continental crust.
Meanwhile, the sediments carried into the ocean by weathering and erosion neutralize the hyper-acidic ocean.
The heavy metals deposited in these rocks and at the ocean ridges
The heavy metals precipitated on these rocks and ridges were trapped deep in the mantle with the plates.
This is how the oceans were cleansed.
By about 4.2 billion years ago, a liquid outer shell had formed at the center of the Earth.
The electric current generated there created a strong magnetic field.
This magnetic field mitigated the cosmic rays that fell to the earth's surface.
This led to the birth of life.
The beginning of life
The beginning of life began when the sun's rays had not yet fully reached the earth.
It began underground in geysers.
When the uranium deposits supplied energy, it reacted with water.
The various alter egos that would become the materials for several
The building blocks of life were formed.
Inside the geyser, when the temperature reaches 100 degrees C, the water is replaced due to the loss of the terrestrial picture.
Therefore, the water never exceeded 100 degrees C, and the molecules created were protected.
The fact that the geyser provided a place to participate in the underground reduction was also an essential condition for the synthesis of molecules.
The tidal force of the moon, which was close to the earth at the time
The tidal force of the moon was much greater than now.
The tidal forces of the moon, which were much larger than those of today, caused the lakes to ebb and flow, creating the dry-lacquer cycle.
The dry-lacquer cycle is an important place to synthesize the building blocks of life.
Fatty acids are packed together to form the wrapping of life.
The repetition of wet and dry conditions
In this way, polymerization reactions proceeded and the necessary atomic materials for proteins with catalytic activity were produced.
And so on.
And as these molecules circulated and mixed, they evolved into even more complex molecules.
The molecular atoms that describe life, rna
These molecules were further mixed with the base paper materials for enzymes to form the
and
and evolve into self-replicating warts.
Thus, Mr. Wun has acquired the ability to replicate the sequence of a statement.
And when these were incorporated into lipid membranes, an atomic life form was born.
This was the starting point for all life.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Plate tectonics began with the birth of the oceans.
The continents were scoured away by powerful tectonic erosion.
And sinking into the mantle.
Thus, the mother continent that gave birth to life
The mother continent, which had given birth to life, disappeared into the depths of the mantle, leaving behind a living organism on the surface, clinging to a small piece of the original continent.
and disappeared into the depths of the mantle.
But
A new drama was about to begin inside the Earth.
The submerged original continent was falling towards strength.
The rocks of the continent were so rich in radioactive isotopes that they self-heated and melted the top of the core.
It melted the top of the core.
This created a strong market around 4.2 billion years ago.
A strong barrier protecting the surface environment.
The statement was no longer exposed to the damaging winds.
Life forms contain
A living organism requires a supply of energy and the circulation of matter, including nutrients.
Life can be described as a constant flow of electrons.
A second life form born underground
A second life form, born underground, becomes separated from its energy source.
The flow of electrons ceased, and they died out.
Life forms mutate and evolve into a wide variety of life forms.
And only those species adapted to the harsh changes in their environment would survive.
Some of them will eventually evolve into secondary life forms.
A few will eventually evolve into secondary life forms.
It had a system that could maintain its metabolism even after the sun had set.
By interacting with the surrounding environment during the day, it was able to maintain its metabolism during the night.
Life switched its energy source from its underground counterpart, the natural nuclear reactor, to the sun above ground.
It evolved into a secondary life form.
The seawater at this time was not yet finished fishing.
Life forms exposed to its deadly poison died out.
But there was one life form that survived the harsh environment.
They coped with the poison by preventing the toxic metal Aegon from entering their bodies.
And as the externally corrected life forms merged with each other, they gradually evolved into a complex ecological system.
The current statement
The current statement utilizes only 20 amino acids.
This may have been the end result of selection during that mass extinction.
There is a fine line between extinction and evolution.
The rna was unstable, but a natural reactor encouraged the formation of a more stable structure.
ionizing radiation, and evolved into stable dna.
Thus was born the tertiary life form, the prokaryote.
The tertiary life forms that emerged were the ancestors of the primitive archaea and eubacteria.
For a life form made of tubular materials, oxygen is a poisonous statement breaker.
The first photosynthetic organisms did not produce oxygen.
They began as anaerobes.
Eventually, atomic life forms developed mechanisms to release and withstand the poisonous oxygen.
This is because oxygen can be used to generate more energy.
Thus was born the cyanobacteria.
The oxygen produced reacts with divalent iron in the sea.
The oxygen produced reacted with the divalent iron in the sea, causing the magnetite to disappear and the sea to be purified.
At this time, however, the salinity was still five times that of today.
As the Earth cooled to a certain degree
As the Earth cooled to a certain degree, the old plate masses that had accumulated at the boundary between the upper and lower mantle began to collapse.
On the other hand, a large number of mantle plumes rise from the lower mantle.
This is the convection called mantle overturn.
The mantle plume lifts part of the surface layer
and form small continents of basalt.
Cyanobacteria need moderate shallow water for light to penetrate.
The inviting dic created by the mantle overturn helped with that.
And the massive amount of oxygen produced changed the Earth's atmosphere.
Meanwhile, in the ocean, the participating iron oxide accumulated as red iron ore on the sea floor.
And the Ministry of Striated Iron Ore Formation was born.
By about 2.5 billion years ago, the thickness of this layer reached several kilometers.
As a result, the iron ions in the sea decreased rapidly, and the color of the sea approached its current blue.
In this way, organisms began to change the Earth's surface environment on their own.
This is how life on Earth began to give rise to civilization.
This was the first step in the full-scale co-evolution of life on Earth.
The collision between the Milky Way and a dwarf galaxy compressed the interstellar gas and caused explosive star formation.
Within a few tens of millions of years, the largest catchers of the stars formed went supernova, one after another.
A large number of spacecraft attacked the solar system.
As the fury sphere contracted, the Earth was bombarded with cosmic rays.
The spaceships caused a nucleation effect, and the Earth was covered with clouds.
As a result, not enough of the sun's energy reached the earth's surface.
A global freeze occurs.
And the spacecraft reaching the surface and the global freeze caused the mass extinction.
But underneath the ice, there was a small amount of life that survived this environment.
It's as if the Earth protected life with a veil of ice.
The Earth has created a massive material cycle driven by response.
The Earth is encased in a biosphere that protects life.
The Earth's environment is deeply connected to the universe.
The whole thing works as one system.
Boon.
The prokaryotes that survived the mass extinction caused by the global freeze
The prokaryotes that survived the mass extinction caused by the freezing of the entire planet expanded their internal corrections to become even larger.
Mitochondria, the oxygen-consuming organisms.
The mitochondria, which are oxygen-consuming organisms, and the chloroplast macrocycle, which is an oxygen generator.
They could now use oxygen as a weapon of energy.
The number of mitochondria thus corrected exceeded several thousand.
Also, to protect the dna from the high oxygen levels in the water, a cornea was created to enclose it.
The dna became so large that it was able to hold the entire array of life on the hawk.
As a result, it was able to create more complex and diverse life forms.
Thus, eukaryotes were born.
They were a million times larger than prokaryotes.
The great evolution of life has been repeated every time there is a threat of mass extinction.
The Great Evolution of Life
The natural world, if left unchecked, can go from order to disorder.
But on the contrary, life is becoming more orderly and complex, which seems to defy the law of entropy.
It seems to defy the law of entropy.
Plate tectonics has caused the enemy continents to merge into one.
The supercontinent Nuna emerged.
The land area increased.
The resulting increase in terrestrial lake environments allowed bacteria to flourish in the field of vision.
And in the vicinity of rivers and wetlands.
They expanded their habitat to include rivers, wetlands, and brackish water.
Cyanobacteria produce mountain lodges through photosynthesis.
However, the oxygen is consumed to join the dead cyanobacteria, and as a result, the rate of increase is minimal.
The rate of increase is minimal.
On the other hand, on the chrysanthemum
On chrysanthemums, on the other hand, dead cyanobacteria are trapped underground by weathering and erosion.
On the chrysanthemum, on the other hand, dead cyanobacteria are trapped underground by weathering and erosion, so they do not participate, causing a large increase in oxygen concentration.
The land produced more oxygen than the ocean.
The increase in continental area led to a dramatic increase in standby oxygen levels.
The name of the supercontinent was eventually split.
Eventually, the name of the supercontinent split.
Its true identity, Riku, gathered near the equator and the show continent
Rodinia was born.
The assembled oceanic plates burrowed beneath the continental plates.
The oceanic plate dug beneath the continental plate and formed a slab that fell into the ocean.
The slab's lower temperature than its surroundings caused a change in the Tenryu flowing in the core.
This caused the dipole ground to become a quadrupole field, weakening the Earth's magnetic field.
The Milky Way Galaxy collides with a dwarf galaxy again
causing a starburst.
These stars eventually went supernova, pouring large amounts of radiation onto the Earth.
The Earth, whose magnetic field had been weakened, was strongly affected by this explosion.
As a result, the Earth's surface was once again covered in ice.
A series of supernova explosions caused the Earth to experience short periods of extreme cold and
A series of supernova explosions caused the Earth to undergo severe weather changes, with short periods of extreme cold and repeated periods of very cold weather.
During the extreme cold period, the oxygen concentration dropped to the level of the drumsticks.
Mass extinction of life occurred.
However, this mass extinction created an opportunity for the birth of new and different species.
The repeated spacecraft arrivals and the drastic changes in oxygen levels will cause genetic mutations.
Repeated spacecraft arrivals and violent fluctuations in oxygen levels have caused genetic mutations
causing the birth of new species and accelerating the evolution of life.
Eventually, when the starbursts ended and the Earth's magnetic field
The Earth's magnetic field returned to a dipole field.
The active high rigidity of the Earth's magnetic field returned, and oxygen levels returned to normal.
Meanwhile, the temperature of the Earth's interior has been gradually decreasing.
When the internal temperature was high enough, the seawater component of the Kaio plate was released.
The water circulates near the surface.
The temperature level remained constant.
However, when the temperature of the upper mantle dropped below 60510 degrees
As the temperature of the upper mantle dropped below 60510 degrees, hydrous minerals were brought into the upper mantle.
And the seawater fell into the Earth's interior like the uncorking of a bath.
This is an inevitable phenomenon on a planet that is continually cooling, and is known as a leaky planet.
As a result, about 3% of the previous water was lost.
As a result, about 3% of the previous water has disappeared, and the level has dropped 600 meters.
This increased the land area and the continental shelf area where sunlight can reach.
And that creates a lot of huge rivers that supply nutrients to the continental shelf.
And this increased the oxygen concentration.
This mighty action would eventually lead to
This mighty action prompted an explosive biological spring song.
To withstand repeated climate changes, the statement entered a new stage of evolution.
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes came together.
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes have evolved into a symbiotic organism.
This strategy of living as a whole, compensating for each other's shortcomings, has greatly expanded the possibilities of life.
The size of organisms has increased a million-fold.
The size of the organism has increased a million-fold.
The size of the organism has increased a million-fold, and compared to prokaryotes, it is a trillion times larger.
This new river has enormous implications for the development of life.
A small ice age will come again, and mass extinction will occur.
However, when this ice age passed and a warm period arrived
However, when this ice age passed and a warm period came, the supply of nutrients, mainly from the bell, into the ocean increased.
An army of flora and fauna emerged from the area at once.
This creature was representative of this era, and it was over a meter long.
It was a creature of the South Pacific.
It was a creature from the South Pacific.
It was a creature of the Southwest.
They are thought to have inhabited the warm hulls of ships.
Nutrients from the continent and oxygen levels were increasing.
The amount of iron in the oceanic oceans increased.
They participated in the recession of the striated iron ore province.
As a result, the concentration of calcium regia increased, and a variety of organisms were created to take advantage of it.
This creature was covered in a large skeleton and used the calcium as armor to protect itself from other creatures.
In order to survive, organisms evolve by using the materials they are given.
The earth's environment changes the form of life.
The Earth's environment is undergoing another period of cataclysmic change.
In the course of tens of millions of years, the Earth went through several periods of extreme cold and very early periods.
This led to the extinction of the eastern flora from the area.
But a new life was about to begin.
Radiation from the Earth's interior also plays an important role in the evolution of life.
Where continents break apart, magma rich in radioactive elements erupts.
This radiation promotes the birth of new species
It creates new species and makes a big and lucky break in the phylogenetic tree of life.
This kind of evolution is called stem evolution.
The organism evolved in isolation on land in a fragmented trading corps.
Once the divided continents collided again and fused together, there was an evolutionary explosion of life at the site of the continental collision.
The new combinations create a variety of variations.
These new combinations produce a variety of organisms.
This is called crown evolution.
As a result of continental collisions, the surface environment became more diverse, and closed oceans were formed, which carried large amounts of nutrients and nitrates.
and nitrates.
This explosive evolution caused the Cambrian explosion of life.
This evolutionary explosion resulted in the creation of 35 new sentences.
This evolutionary explosion produced 35 sentences and created the master plan for life as we know it today.
There are three patterns to the evolution of life.
Wiping out the organisms that reflected it.
Mass extinction
Promote genetic mutation as continents split
New book
Creation of diversity by collision of continents
The evolution of life is closely linked to changes in the Earth's environment and continents that are linked to the universe.
Evolution of life is closely linked to changes in the Earth's environment, which is linked to the universe, and to continental development in Australia.
The salinity of seawater, which was originally more than five times that of today, has been gradually decreasing since about 600 million years ago.
It was the loss of a huge land mass.
The reason for this is that the salt in the seawater was taken up by the continents as rock salt due to the huge land gaffes and the lowering of the circulation level caused by the leaking earth.
This is the result of the salt in the seawater being taken into the continents as rock salt.
And even if the lower levels are temporarily high
Even if the lower levels were temporarily higher, the sediments were reduced to 2 and the salt did not leach into the ocean.
As the salinity of the seawater decreased.
As the salinity of the seawater decreased, the environment became ready for organisms to move into not only the brackish water but also the large stock.
The increase in oxygen concentration created an ozone layer in the upper layers of the atmosphere.
This layer cut off ultraviolet rays and created a habitat for organisms on land.
The algae that thrived in the cirrus were the first to move onto land, where they were exposed to a harsh environment.
This allowed them to evolve ahead of animals.
Later, insects appeared and caused the evolution of phytothorax.
During the Cambrian period, vertebrates evolved, and during this period, fish were born.
This is the common ancestor of all vertebrates.
Fishes continued to evolve and became the ancestors of administrative animals.
The Ichthyostega is born.
At this time, oxygen levels were 1.5 times higher than today due to the oxygen produced by flourishing plants.
at this time.
These plants were later deposited in the earth's rotation and turned into coal, which contributed greatly to humanity's progress during the Industrial Revolution.
These plants were later deposited in circles and turned into coal, contributing greatly to humanity's breakthrough in Industrial Revolution technology.
Finally, vertebrates, which had acquired lung function, moved onto land.
From these amphibians came reptiles, dinosaurs, and mammals, which in turn evolved into humans.
He doesn't know that yet.
The corresponding model collided with the Dark Nebula.
As a result of its passage through the interior of the nebula, a massive amount of spacecraft rained down on Earth.
This caused the Earth to enter a period of extreme cold.
First, the vegetation was hit hard, and oxygen levels dropped.
As a result, the Earth's surface reverted to the construction machinery environment of the time of the drumsticks.
The majority of administrative, reptilian, and insect species became extinct.
The creatures that seemed to him to be evolving smoothly.
Once again, he was put to a great test.
Anaerobic microorganisms, which could only survive in anoxic underground environments
back on land and in the ocean.
As they expand their habitat
As their habitat expanded, they began to evolve in the face of increasing oxygen levels.
Thus, preparations were underway to replace the leading role of life on Earth and create the next era.
The birth of a new species that would lead to mankind was imminent.
Boom!
In the rapidly warming continent of Pangaea.
The creatures were divided into mammals and reptiles.
and began to evolve again.
While the reptiles evolved into a wide variety of species
Mammals were nocturnal animals, about the size of a mouse.
They were still in the shadows.
Reptiles, on the other hand, were changing into dinosaurs and were entering their golden age.
They took advantage of their superior body mass to lead the race for survival.
The Hyrule magma caused a mutation.
Organisms stemmed evolution as the continents split.
The dinosaurs would reign supreme in the global ecosystem.
The northern part of the divided Pangaea re-fused.
Here, crown evolution occurred.
As the continents separated and dispersed, organisms evolved and created a wide variety of species.
And they spread to all the continents.
Thus, the age reflected by the dinosaurs arrived.
Meanwhile, plants had a more advanced reproductive system.
In plants, a more advanced reproductive system was born: the angiosperm.
By pollinating with the help of animals, the angiosperms expanded their habitat.
As a result, plants were gradually deprived of their habitat.
The birth of primates, which led to humans, occurred in the rift of Gondwana.
From rodents such as rats and rabbits, new hands were born through stem evolution.
Gondwana was further divided into South America and Africa.
The ancestors of primates that migrated to South America evolved there in isolation to become New World monkeys.
On the other hand, the African continent changed into the Old World monkeys.
In the Indian continent, which was separated from Antarctica, they changed into lorises.
In this way, each continent's laws stopped their own evolution.
The various primate masters diverged.
A massive plume pushed up the Pacific Plate.
The level of the Pacific Ocean rose.
This caused the lowlands of all the continents to turn.
Land area decreased.
The fragmentation of the land masses allowed for portable evolution
The fragmentation of the land masses will encourage mobile evolution, adapted to each environment.
Events in outer space have radically altered the Earth's environment.
And once again, the solar system collided with the Dark Nebula.
The Earth was covered in clouds.
As a result, the Earth became colder and colder, and ecosystems were severely damaged.
Then, a huge meteorite with a diameter of about 10 kilometers hit the place where the Yucatan Peninsula is today.
This is what ultimately caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.
This repeated mass extinction
This repeated mass extinction tells us again and again that we have a deep connection with the universe.
It's not just cold weather and mass extinctions that cause this.
The spacecraft directly affects dna
which forms a statement.
It promotes evolution by causing mutations.
Life on our planet is connected to the universe on every scale.
That's how the dinosaurs died out in all their glory.
In the Rift Valley of Africa, an explosion of volcanic activity occurred.
Magma rich in radioactive elements was lost.
A new brew was born out of the old world.
This is thought to be the distant ancestor of mankind.
It has been about 4.5 billion years since the birth of the earth.
The big glasses version that I have visited many times
Countless times in the past.
And finally
And finally, man raised his part.
It was the beginning of the human race.
What separates us from other primates...
It's a genetic region in the dna called spring.
This is what allowed us to grow our brains to such a large size that we gained the ability to speak.
We acquired the ability to construct, remember, create.
We can see that the volume of the brain has increased in three successive, discontinuous cycles.
At the same time, there was a massive eruption.
The timing of these eruptions suggests that this is the result of stem evolution caused by a fiery magma.
Since about 1.2 million years ago, people have been moving to other areas intermittently.
especially in Africa, where they stood about 200,000 years ago.
Mitochondrial Eve and 8
Mitochondrial Eve moved to North and Central America about 15,000 years ago.
By 10,000 years ago, they had reached the southern tip of the South American continent and had spread throughout the world.
And so began a breakthrough in human civilization.
Humans invented agriculture and cattle breeding, which led to a stable food supply.
This led to an explosion in population.
A large variety of occupational cultures
Owners of manufactured goods began to barter
Cities emerged to do this more efficiently
Smaller cities with floral patterns, economies, law courts
Smaller countries emerged with institutions such as law, courts, and police.
Thus, four major civilizations were born in the great battle for the greatest agricultural productivity.
Each civilization had its own ideas, and their territories went through many changes.
To avoid this, religion began to rule the people instead of the hereditary rule of the cherry-picked.
Eventually, the people began to elect their leaders.
Modern democracies are born.
This led to the creation of a mobile society with freedom, equality, and basic human rights.
From Newton's book Principia
The Industrial Revolution began in England and other countries.
Technology developed and applied based on science brought revolutionary changes to human society.
The invention of the steam locomotive led to the transportation of goods by rail
People can travel large distances with ease
Human society has entered an era of unprecedented prosperity.
But there were constant wars.
The knowledge man has acquired through science has sometimes caused irreversible tragedies.
The information revolution with the invention of the computer allowed mankind to go into space, as exemplified by the Apollo missions.
And the Internet ushered in a new era of instantaneous global connectivity.
Out of regret for the past wars the birth of a unified world nation has become a reality.
The year 1993
The most frequent and repeated war in Europe.
The United States of America!
In other parts of the world, alliances were formed, and the world was on the verge of a unified state.
In all the images in the Atlas of the Earth, this show of the human platform is very short.
But that's how far we've come in Earth's history.
Morphologically, mankind is just another species of animal.
But we are qualitatively different from all other creatures.
We are conscious beings.
And since our creation...
I wonder what awaits us.
The fossil fuels that human society uses have been stored over billions of years of Earth's history.
We are now consuming them at an alarming rate.
Fossil fuels will rapidly decrease after 2020.
Fossil fuels are predicted to be depleted by the year 2100.
But the shale gas revolution will postpone that by 100 years.
On the other hand, the world population will explode due to the improvement of medical science and nutritious food.
This will lead to a serious food shortage from around 2020.
The age of 3 billion refugees will begin.
The number of refugees is expected to peak at 10 billion in 2050 and decline to 5 billion by 2100.
By 2100, the number of refugees is expected to decrease to 5 billion.
The period up to 2050 will see a rapid increase in population, which will cause serious environmental pollution.
The future of humanity will be marked by a rapid increase in population, severe environmental pollution, and a variety of global challenges that will increase anxiety.
What will happen to the future of humanity after that?
In the world of science, super innovative technologies will develop at an accelerated pace.
A space station will be built on the moon, and humans will be preparing to enter the elementary school of the solar system.
A robot will assist human activities in space exploration.
Self-replicating robots emerge and evolve beyond human limits.
These artificial life forms.
Eventually, they will expand into the galaxy 8.
The technology to travel to other dimensions was born.
We will be able to perceive the world beyond time and space.
And the role of humanity as a living organism will come to an end.
The end of the human era.
Perhaps this is an inevitable consequence of the evolutionary strategy of life.
Why?
Because the future of our planet is about to see more upheaval than ever before.
All the continents, especially Asia, will come together to form a supercontinental rain gauge.
Plants will consume the co2 in the atmosphere and take carbon into their bodies.
They will then burrow into the ground with the carbon, thus reducing the atmospheric CO2.
The supercontinent is the result of the increase in the area of the continent due to the emergence of the Meiji era.
As a result of the increase in the area of the continent due to the emergence of the Meiji era, more and more plants buried atmospheric co2 in the ground.
co2 will be reduced to one tenth of the current level.
This will lead to a very high CO2 requirement.
C 4 plants will start to collapse.
And the organisms that depend on them for food will be affected.
For 600 million years, seawater has been trapped in the mantle.
It's been declining.
This will cause the ocean ridges to appear on the surface.
The water that lubricates the mantle is no longer available.
Plate tectonics will cease.
This is an inevitable consequence of a cooling planet.
Volcanic activity will cease in the subduction zone.
The land that is no longer dragon knight will undergo severe environmental changes through erosion.
The Earth's magnetic field disappears as the cooling power of the outer horizon decreases.
The atmosphere will be stripped away by the corresponding winds, and the oceanic components will dissipate into space.
At this point, large multicellular organisms living on the surface become extinct.
The few organisms that survive in the solar column will eventually all die off as the oceans disappear.
Thus, the Earth's statement is annihilated.
The overheating of the solar surface will accelerate this process.
Earth's surface temperature will reach 500 degrees C, as it did in the modern era.
The Andromeda Galaxy collides with our Milky Way Galaxy.
This collision ridicules the frequency of compositional births.
They will eventually go supernova.
The Earth will be bombarded with powerful spacecraft.
The expanding sun
The earth was swallowed by the expanding sun
This is the day when the Earth that nurtured our noodles
The day we disappear from the universe.
But the life that was born here is changing shape.
And that it has already spread to other galaxies.
